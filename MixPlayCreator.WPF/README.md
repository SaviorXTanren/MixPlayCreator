# mixer-client-csharp
A C# client library for the Mixer streaming service

## What is this?
Unsatisfied with the current set of APIs that exist to interact with Mixer, I took some time to build and design an API set in C# to interact with the service. This API set can be used by anyone to build out any apps they wish to use and itâ€™s very easy to setup.

## Requirements
This library uses the native WebSocket support found in Windows 8 & higher. This means that any application that uses this library must be running Windows 8 or higher.

## Current functionality
We have must of the most common usage scenarios completed, including:
- The most common REST APIs for Channels, Chat, Interactive, and Users services
- WebSocket-based clients to use Chat, Interactive, and Constellation features
- Various OAuth logic flows to allow your application to authenticate with the Mixer endpoints and handle authorization scopes
- Unit tests and sample applications to document and show usage of all functionality

## Feature roadmap
These are the current planned features to be developed in priority order:
- Add ViewModels to all APIs to make ramp-up development work easier and put less focus on knowing the dev docs top-to-bottom
- Continue filling out REST API services with less-common methods
- Add full documentation to github for API usage

## How do I get started using it?
Download the NuGet package by searching for "mixer-client-csharp" or downloading it manually from https://www.nuget.org/packages/mixer-client-csharp. There are two sample apps created the help showcase some the setup needed and how to use the APIs. Additionally, there are a large serious of unit tests that go through all of the individual functionality that you can look at. I plan on creating more formal documentation soon.

## I found a bug, who do I contact?
Just head over to the https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-client-csharp/issues page and create a new issue.

## I have a new feature idea!
Submit feature requests at the https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-client-csharp/issues page or feel free to develop the feature yourself and submit a pull request at https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-client-csharp/pulls! I'm happy to assist anyone if they're interested in developing something as well.
